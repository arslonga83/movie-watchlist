#Movie Watchlist

https://arslonga83.github.io/movie-watchlist/index.html

This is one of the solo projects from Scrimba's API section. It lets the user search for movie titles by calling the OMDB movie database API, and then save selected movies to a watchlist. The watchlist is saved in local storage and users can click another button to remove titles. 

I mostly used flexbox for responsive styling, and change direction from row to column for small screens.
